# RandoGameReview

Repository for the website RandoGameReviews.com

Small site I created using Node.js to get my beak wet a little.  On the site anyone can submit a simple, anonymous review of a game they finished playing recently.  

My goal was to introduce myself to Node.JS and create a dynamic single paged site using AJAX calls.

Eventhough this repository is small I learned a great deal about Javascript,Node.JS, Express, MongoDB and Jade while 
developing it.  All of which I had no prior experience with.
