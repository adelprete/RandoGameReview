# RandoGameReview

Site: RandogameReviews.com

Small site I created to get my beak wet in Node.js.  Anyone can submit a simple, anonymous review of a game they 
finished playing recently.  My goal was to introduce myself to Node.JS and create a dynamic single paged site using AJAX calls.

Eventhough this repository is small I learned a great deal about Javascript,Node.JS, Express, MongoDB and Jade while 
developing it.  All of which I had no prior experience in.
